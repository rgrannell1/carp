carp is a simple dependency-checker that checks a host matches the expected configuration. It performs dependency-checks in parallel, so it's very fast.

## Usage

```zsh
carp --file <fpath>
```

## Stability Index

1, Experimental - This project might die, it's undertested and underdocumented, and redesigns and breaking changes are likely

## Files

```
carp.go
cli.go
dependencies.go
```

## Carpfile

Dependencies are specified in a JSON file with the following format. This file is cumbersome to write directly, so I'd recommend creating a Python or SH executable file that echos the required JSON.

```
{
  // -- you can choose any group-names, but by default "main" is expected.
  "variables": {
    "requires": [
      /// -- list of variable dependencies
    ]
  },
  programs: {
    "requires": [
      // -- list of program dependencies
    ]
  },
  main: {
    requires: [
      // -- by default, the main group is checked. Depend on
      // -- other groups to organise dependencies tidily.
    ]
  }
}
```
