# carp üêü

carp is a simple dependency-checker that checks a host matches the expected configuration. It performs dependency-checks in parallel, so it's very fast.

## Usage

```zsh
carp --file <fpath>
```

## Stability Index

1, Experimental - This project might die, it's undertested and underdocumented, and redesigns and breaking changes are likely

## Build

To test carp, run:

```bash
go run *.go $HOME/carpfile.py --group main
```

To install carp, run:

```bash
cp carp /usr/bin/carp
```

## Files

```
carp.go
cli.go
dependencies.go
```

## Carpfile

Dependencies are specified in a JSON file with the format below. This file is cumbersome to write directly, so I'd recommend creating a Python or SH executable file that echos the required JSON.

Multiple machines can be configured by creating seperate carp groups; one for a laptop and one for a devbox in this case.
